# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Common Behavioral Design Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
    - Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
    - Each handler can either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

- **Command Pattern**
    - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
    - Supports undoable operations.

- **Interpreter Pattern**
    - Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
    - Useful for implementing specialized languages.

- **Iterator Pattern**
    - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    - Promotes iteration abstraction.

- **Mediator Pattern**
    - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    - Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

- **Memento Pattern**
    - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
    - Allows the object to be restored to this state later.

- **Observer Pattern**
    - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    - Promotes a subscription mechanism.

- **State Pattern**
    - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    - The object will appear to change its class.

- **Strategy Pattern**
    - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    - Allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

- **Template Method Pattern**
    - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    - Promotes code reuse.

- **Visitor Pattern**
    - Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
    - Allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Benefits of Behavioral Design Patterns
- **Flexibility**: They provide flexibility in communication between objects.
- **Reusability**: They promote reusability by decoupling the communication between objects.
- **Maintainability**: They enhance code maintainability by promoting clear and understandable communication patterns.
