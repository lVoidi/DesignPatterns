# Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns focus on handling the creation process to make it more adaptable and flexible.

## Common Creational Design Patterns
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**
    - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - Promotes consistency among products.

- **Builder Pattern**
    - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
    - Allows the same construction process to create different representations.

- **Factory Method Pattern**
    - Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
    - Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.

- **Prototype Pattern**
    - Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance.
    - Creates new objects by copying this prototype.

- **Singleton Pattern**
    - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    - Useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Benefits of Creational Design Patterns
- **Flexibility**: They provide flexibility in terms of what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when.
- **Reusability**: They promote reusability by decoupling the client code from the object creation process.
- **Scalability**: They help in managing object creation in large and complex systems by providing scalable solutions.
